# Introduction
This project was made as homework for an algorithm course held at Politecnico di Milano between 2018 and 2019 and gained a mark of 30 cum laude/30 because of its efficiency.

# Commands

- addent "<ent_name>", which initializes an entity in the graph;

- addrel "<origin_ent>" "<destination_ent>" "<rel_name>", which adds a relationship named <rel_name> between the two entities;

- delrel "<origin_ent>" "<destination_ent>" "<rel_name>", which deletes the trlationship named <rel_name> between the two entities;

- delent "<ent_name>", which deletes <ent_name> from the monitored entities and also deletes all the relationships in which it is involved;

- report, which prints on screen iteratively the name of the type of relationship, the entities with the highest incoming relationships of that type and the number of the maximum incoming relationships;

- end, which terminates the program.
